"rgt_status database"
    Where is this and how do I access it for queries?

Should I only be worrying about summitdev stuff or also look into Titan?

I can look into jobs using bjobs but I presume we will migrate all of this information to a database.
Should I go ahead and use some bash scripts to go about getting information like in issues #1 or is
there some better way to go about doing this?

What is the server we should send emails from? We will probably need to create one.
